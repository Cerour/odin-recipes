                <li>1 avocado, quartered and sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>For the Sauce:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sour cream (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 small clove garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons aji amarillo chili paste, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon water as needed</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Combine chicken, green peas, carrot, shallot, roasted red peppers, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl. Season with salt and cayenne. Add mayonnaise and mix until combined. Cover chicken salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until very tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Drain well and transfer potatoes to a mixing bowl. Mash until smooth.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Add jai amarillo, olive oil, and lime juice to the potatoes. Season with cayenne and salt. Mash together with the potato masher. Switch to a spatula and mix until completely smooth.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Line four 6-ounce ramekins with plastic wrap. Scoop mashed potatoes evenly into ramekins; press and smooth out the tops. Cover each with a layer of avocado slices. Fill ramekin to the top with chicken salad, pressing it down and pulling up the plastic wrap to eliminate any air pockets. Cover with a final layer of mashed potatoes, going up to 1/2 inch or more over the rim.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Seal top with a new layer of plastic wrap and fold the sides over to seal. Refrigerate salads until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic, and aji amarillo together for the sauce, adding a splash of water to adjust the thickness.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Remove the top layer of plastic wrap from each salad. Invert each ramekin onto a serving plate; remove ramekins, then plastic wrap. Spoon some sauce around each salad.</p>
